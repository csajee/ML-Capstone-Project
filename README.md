# ML-Capstone-Project
An ML project to showcase the algorithms learnt during the Machine Learning course in the BS degree in Data Science and Applications from IIT Madras.

This capstone project uses Machine Learning algorithms to understand the online shopper purchasing pattern and is part of the course Machine Learning. 
The competition was hosted on Kaggle by the institute and the main language used for this project is Python. 
<br/>
I have extensively used the SciKit-Learn package in Python for this project. Other packages from Python used include XGBoost, imblearn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib. 
<br/>
The aim of the project was to build a good classification model that will be able to predict whether the customer will be buying the product when they visit the e-commerce wesite or no.
